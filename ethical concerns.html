                    This section will provide resources available to give guidance on what ethical concerns need to be considered during testing<br>
                    No specific legal or ethical advice will be given, due to the specific indivudual nature of each penetration test.

                    Prior to conducting a Social Engineering Penetration test, the tester and client need to discuss in depth methods which are disallowed from<br>
                    being used, along with aspects of the business which are off-limits for the tester to penetrate. This would be covered in the scope discussion<br>
                    and ensures that the tester does not attempt to penetrate any third party companies accidentaly. Third party companies are commonly used<br>
                    by businesses for services, such as cleaning and server hosting. If a tester accidently penetrated one of these companies, it could lead to law<br>
                    suits being broguht toward the tester due to those third party companies not providing explicit concent to test their services.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                Due to the varying nature of laws in different countries and states, it is considered best practice to seek legal advice within the country or state you wish to test prior to,<br>
                or during the initial client meeting, this ensures that all aspects are considered and the tester is acting on the appropriate side of the law during the test. This also ensures<br>
                that the client is aware of the laws and is on board with the type of test and scope which is considered.

                Regarding ethics, a framework for this has been proposed by "www.Social-Engineer.org" CEO Chris Hadnagy. His proposed ethics codes is constructed <br>
                of 11 points which help guide fellow professionals to keep them to a proposed industry standard, based off the idea of "leave them feeling better for having met you".<br>
                This proposed code of ethics can be found at <a href="https://www.social-engineer.org/framework/general-discussion/social-engineering-code-of-ethics/" Social Engineer Code of Ethics></a><br>
                The code of ethics can then be used to cater your exploitation methodologies interactions in order to keep your tests to a professional standard.
