        </div>

<p>
Prior to any form of exploitation taking place, an initial relationship needs to be formed with the target (depending on exploit).<br>
This obviously depends on what form of communication method which is going to be used, for example, spear phishing, or in person, verbal communication.<br>
Once information has been gathered about a target, and an attack vector has been decided upon (dictated by scope and client requirements),<br>
communication and rapport building can begin.
</p>

<p>
Mouton et al. (2016) establish some compliance principles which will aid you when starting communication with a target and beginning to build rapport.
<ol>
<li>Friendship or liking: People are more willing to comply with requests from friends or people they like.</li>
<li>Commitment or consistency: Once committed to something, people are more willing to comply with requests consistent with this position.</li>
<li>Scarcity: People are more willing to comply with requests that are scarce or decreasing in availability.</li>
<li>Reciprocity: People are more willing to comply with a request if the requester has treated them favourably in the past</li>
<li>Social Validation: People are more willing to comply with a request if it is seen as the socially correct thing to do.</li>
<li>Authority: People easily comply with requests received from people with more authority than they have.</li>
</ol>

Using these complicance principles can aid in developing a relationship which results in successful exploitation. Understandably some principles rely on <br>
the tester maintaining a fictional position higher than the target, however, this is possible through impersonisation, whether that be through email, or in person<br>
by using a fictional 3rd party supplier character.
