            <p>
                Prior to conducting any exploitation, information needs to be gathered about the target, whether that be the company, or a specific employee.
            <br>
                The best approach is to find as much publically available information about the targets as possible, prior to engagement.  This can be conducted <br>
                through mutliple different methods, ranging from physical observation, phone calls, emails and OSINT (Open Source Intellegence).
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>OSINT</b><br> 
                This refers to information which is publically available, such as information posted by employees or the company on their own websites, or on <br>
                 social media websites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). OSINT is a resource which can be incredibly useful when finding information needed to <br>
                  formulate an attack, such information as employee badge types can often be found in photos, as well as company heirarchy and contact emails.
            </p>
            <p>
                A tool has already been created to help professionals conduct OSINT investigations, this tool can be found at <b><a href="https://osintframework.com/">OSINTframework</a><b><br>
                This tool is created in the United states, so some sites may not be applicable for those working in other countries. Use your discretion to filter out what is beneficial.

            <p><b>General Information</b></p>
            <p>Specific information required for particular exploits can be found on the particular exploits page, but generic information about a target or company which can prove useful is listed in the following table:</p>
