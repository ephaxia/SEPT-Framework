        <h3>Discussing scope of a SEPT with a client & possible exclusions</h3>
        </div>
<body>
        <div>
        <p>When discussing scope with a client prior to conducting a SEPT, a few important considerations need to be noted and accounted for:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does the client use any third party suppliers for services?</li>
                <li>Does the client want the whole organisation tested, or specific departments/facillities?</li>
                <li>Does the client want a test just on site? Just off-site? Or a mixture of both?</li>
                <li>What is off limits in terms of exploitation techniques?</li>
                <li>"Get out of jail free card" (required if security or law enforcement approaches the tester)</li>
                <li>Will any information be provided on system or systems being tested? (white box or black box testing)</li>
                <li>Is technical exploitation warranted as a combination attack?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These points need to be carefully considered with the client, and discussed in depth prior to commencing.<br>
                Another item to note is ethical and legal considerations (see <a href="Ethical concerns.html">Ethical & Legal concerns</a> for further guidance on this). <br>
                These also need to be discussed with the client, as to what exploitation methods they will allow against their<br>
                 employees. Does any employee pose a risk in terms of mental health, or possible stress issues. Once these <br>
                 items are carefully considered, and a scope is decided upon, the tester can move to the next phase of the SEPT <br>
                 lifecycle, <a href="Information gathering.html">Information gathering</a>.</p>
