        <h3>Discussing findings from SEPT with the client</h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            Following on from post exploitation analysis, this section of the lifecycle covers the outcomes <br>
             of the SEPT with the client. Suggestions for improvement, and areas which worked well from a <br>
              information protection regard.
            <br>
            Post exploitation analysis needs to be transferred into a form which a non-technical client may understand.<br>
            While the client may have employees who are in technical roles, those which the findings are discussed with<br>
             may not be. Catering a discussion for a "lay-man" may be the difference in a SEPT being beneficial or not.
             <br>
             <br>
             <div>
                 One method of forming a discussion is to have two reports:
                 <ul>
                     <li>One technical report - This can be directed soley at those employees who are in charge of technical implementations and policy implementation regarding information security.</li>
                     <li>One non-technical report - This can be directed toward those who do not have a tenical background, or those which may be on the board of directors, so they can assess where their weaknesses lie within the business. This will allow them to have simply what information is needed to distribute funds to the appropriate department. </li>
                 </ul>
                 <br>
                 <p>
                     This simplistic approach to conversations with the client ensures full transparancey of results and where the client can send funds to the departments and areas which require the most improvement in order to meet their needs.<br>
                     Furthermore, the areas which have proved effective from the SEPT can be praised and recieve reinforcement for the work which they are doing, and the policies they are using.<br>
