                Following exploitation the client and tester would need to meet to discuss findings and advice on improvements to security<br>
                A meeting is vital to ensure the client is aware of the test findings and what security flaws are present in their business<br>
                in order for this meeting to be beneficial, the tester needs to document all findings during the penetration test.<br>

                Prior to this meeting with the client, a report needs to be created following the exploitation. Evaluation of the SEPT is vital to ensure<br>
                results form the test have external validity, meaning they would be applicable when transferred to a real world scenario. Without this <br>
                the test is arguably null and void. If it did not effectively measure what the discussed scope stated it should, it is of no benefit to the client.<br>
                When evaluating the exploitation phase, it is important to consider the following aspects:

            <ul>
                <li>Was The exploit a success? If not, why not? </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Was this a result of poor planning, or good protective measures?</li>
                    <li>Were employees aware of the exploit occuring?</li>
                    <li>Were you challenged at any point? If so, did it prevent further progress, or not?</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Did the attack replicate a real world scenario?</li>
                <li>How much important information was available on social media?</li>
                <li>Was the effectiveness of the exploit a result of co-ersion from the tester, or poor security practices?</li>
                <li>What methods didn't work?</li>
                <li>What improvements could be made? How would these be administered</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>People oriented/Training</li>
                    <li>Technical?</li>
                    <li>Physical Security measures</li>
                    <li>Policy changes</li>
